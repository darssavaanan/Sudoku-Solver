# Sudoku-Solver

Sudoku is a logic-based,combinatorial number-placement puzzle . In Sudoku, the objective is to fill a 9 × 9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3 × 3 subgrids that compose the grid contains all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution.

In this project , we have made a sudoku board using tkinter which can be solved on your own or you can click on the 'Show Solution' button to get the solution. We need to input the sudoku board row-wise.
